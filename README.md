# Basic-Portfolio
My basic portfolio was an interesting project because it helped me understand a little better how to position sections, learning more when to use relative, absolute, fixed, z-index, etc. 

I imagine there are many different ways to setup the Portfolio page. I essentially setup two rows, each starting from a different vertical position and floating left across the row. The text banner running through the images were handled by applying a negative top margin value. 

The Contact form, of course, is just for appearance. Will be interested in getting it to post data with a sql server. 

I added was using display:none and display:block with a hover action. If you pass the mouse over my name in the upper left corner you will see a different photo of me as a kid on each page.

I am going to try to make this website responsive and submit an alternative if successful. I believe this topic is going to be the topic of Saturday's session.
